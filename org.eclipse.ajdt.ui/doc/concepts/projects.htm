    <h1>AspectJ projects</h1>

    <p>An AspectJ project contains source code and related files for building an AspectJ
    program. It has an associated AspectJ builder that can incrementally compile Java and AspectJ 
    source files as they are changed.</p>

    <p>A Java project maintains a model of its contents that
 	is constantly updated as the user changes the Java source code.  AspectJ projects are an extension
 	to Java projects and so they also have such a model, as well as making available all the functions 
 	and features that you can use with Java projects in Eclipse.
 	</p>
    
    <p>An AspectJ project also maintains a model of its crosscutting information.  This
    model is updated every time the project is built. </p>
