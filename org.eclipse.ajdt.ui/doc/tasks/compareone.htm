      Comparing with the current build
    </h1>
    <p>
      To compare a crosscutting map file with the current build:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select a file with the ".ajmap" extension in the Package Explorer.</li>
      <li>Right click and select <b>AspectJ Tools &gt; Compare Crosscutting With
          Current Build.</b>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
       The results of the comparison are then shown in the 
       <b>Crosscutting Comparison</b> view, which is opened in the current
       perspective if it is not already showing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
       When the Crosscutting Comparison view is used to compare a crosscutting map file
       with the current build it will update automatically with every subsequent build.
       This provides an ongoing view of how the crosscutting relationships present 
       in a project are changing in response to code changes in the project.
