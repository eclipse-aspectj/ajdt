    <h1>
      Creating a nested aspect
    </h1>
    <p>
      You can create aspects that are enclosed in other types (that is, nested aspects).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open the New Aspect wizard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Edit the&nbsp;<strong>Source Folder</strong> field to indicate in which folder you want the new aspect to reside. You can either type a path or
        click&nbsp;<strong>Browse</strong> to find the folder. If a folder is found for the current selection, that folder appears in
        the&nbsp;<strong>Source Folder</strong> field as the container for the new aspect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the&nbsp;<strong>Enclosing Type</strong> check box and type the name of the enclosing type in the <strong>Enclosing Type</strong> field. You can
        also click&nbsp;<strong>Browse</strong> to select the enclosing type for the new aspect.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the&nbsp;<strong>Name</strong> field, type a name for the new aspect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the desired modifiers by using the&nbsp;<strong>Modifiers</strong> radio buttons and check boxes.
        Note that <em>static</em> should not be de-selected because nested aspects must be static.  
      </li>
      <li>
        In the&nbsp;<strong>Supertype</strong> field, type or click&nbsp;<strong>Browse</strong> to select a superclass/aspect for the new aspect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the&nbsp;<strong>Add</strong> button to add interfaces for the new aspect to implement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the&nbsp;<strong>public static void main(String[] args)</strong> check box if you want the wizard to add the main method to the new aspect, thus
        making it a starting point of an application.
      </li>
      <li>
      	Select the <strong>Inherited abstract pointcuts</strong> box if you have overridden an abstract aspect
      	and want the wizard to generate stubs for the abstract pointcuts.
      <li>
        Select the <strong>Generate comments</strong> box if you want the wizard to generate comments, as configured in the properties
        for the project.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click&nbsp;<strong>Finish</strong> when you are done.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the enclosing type is a class, you may wish to change the file extension in order to avoid 
        errors in the editor and to have the AspectJ content correctly displayed in views such as the Outline view and the 
        Package Explorer.  Right click on the file in the package explorer then select
        <strong>Convert file extension to .aj</strong>.
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The new aspect is created in the same compilation unit as its enclosing type.
