/**
 * When a Java15ReflectionBasedDelegate gets the pointcuts for a given class it tries to resolve them before returning. This can
 * cause problems if the resolution of one pointcut in the type depends on another pointcut in the same type. Therefore the
 * algorithm proceeds in two phases, first we create and store instances of this class in the pointcuts array, and once that is
 * done, we come back round and resolve the actual pointcut expression. This means that if we recurse doing resolution, we will find
 * the named pointcut we are looking for!
