 * @author colyer This subclass of UnwovenClassFile allows a third-party to manage the actual bytes that comprise the class. This
 *         means the third party can return a reference to an existing array, or create the bytes on demand, or apply any other
 *         strategy that makes sense. By refering to bytes held elsewhere, the goal is to reduce the overall memory consumption by
 *         not holding a copy.
