Test to ensure don't rebuild if src file changes which isn't in active build config file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ade 11-07-2008  Using new build config now.  There is no more "Build Path > Exclide" option.


(1) Import the AspectJ Bean Example into your workspace
(2) Create a DummyClass in the bean package (File > New > Class)
(3) Exclude DummyClass from the active build configuration (right click and choose
    "Build Path > Exclude"
(4) Add the following method to DummyClass:

		public dummyMethod() {
		}
		
(5) Save DummyClass and no build should occur - so there should be no error
    warnings about the syntax in the Problems view. (BUILD_1)
		    
(6) Create a DummyAspect in the bean package (File > New > Aspect)
(7) Exclude DummyAspect from the active build configuration (right click and choose
    "Build Path > Exclude"
(8) Add the following badly formed pointcut to DummyAspect:

		pointcut.....
		
(9) Save DummyAspect and no build should occur - so there should be no error warnings
    about the syntax in the Problems view. (BUILD_2)
