Wizard Tests
---------------

1. AJDT Plugin Export Wizard - Export without source
----------------------------------------------------

 a.	Install AJDT and check out the “Hello World Plugin” project from
    org.eclipse.ajdt.tests/test projects on the Eclipse CVS repository.  Launch
    a runtime workbench and click ‘Sample Menu’ > ‘Sample Action’ to verify the
    plugin is working. You should see a dialog box containing the text “Hello
    Eclipse and Hello from AspectJ”.
 b.	Right Click on the project then click ‘Export’.  Select ‘Deployable plug-ins
    and fragments with AspectJ Support’, then click ‘Next’.
    - The ‘Archive file:’ box within the "Export Declaration" area of the dialog
      should be checked.
    - Ensure that the ‘Include source code’ checkbox is unchecked.  Select an
      appropriate name and location for the zip file within the editable text field
      associated with the ‘Archive file:’ box within the "Export Declaration" area
      of the dialog (e.g. C:\temp\helloworld.zip)
    - Click ‘Finish’.
 c.	Open the zip file using WinZip or another archiving program.  Extract the
    contents to an appropriate directory (e.g. C:\temp).  This directory will now
    contain a ‘plugins’ folder, which itself contains a folder with the name of your
    plug-in (e.g. HelloWorld_1.0.0).  Open the JAR file in this folder.  Check that
    this JAR file contains the .CLASS files for any aspects you had in your project
    and that it contains no .AJ or .JAVA files.
    		(WIZ_1)
 d.	Test the plug-in by extracting the zip file into the ‘eclipse’ directory,
    within the directory that you have Eclipse installed, then starting the workbench
    and checking that the ‘Sample Menu’ and ‘Sample Action’ are present and work as
    described in a.

2. AJDT Plugin Export Wizard - Export with source
-------------------------------------------------

 a.	Check out the test plug-in project, as defined in part 1a above.
 b.	Right Click on the project in Eclipse then click ‘Export’.  Select ‘Deployable
    plug-ins and fragments with AspectJ Support’, then click ‘Next’.
    - The ‘Archive file:’ box within the "Export Declaration" area of the dialog
      should be checked.
    - Ensure that the ‘Include source code’ checkbox is checked.  Select an
      appropriate name and location for the zip file within the editable text field
      associated with the ‘Archive file:’ box within the "Export Declaration" area
      of the dialog (e.g. C:\temp\helloworld.zip)
    - Click ‘Finish’.
 c.	Open the zip file using WinZip or another archiving program.  Extract the contents
    to an appropriate directory (e.g. C:\temp).  This directory will now contain a
    ‘plugins’ folder, which itself contains a folder with the name of your plug-in
    (e.g. HelloWorld_1.0.0).  Open the JAR file in this folder.  Check that this JAR
    file contains the .CLASS files for any aspects and classes you had in your project.  
    There should also be a zip file within the zip file created in b.  This should
    contain all the .AJ and .JAVA files in your project.
    		(WIZ_3)
 d.	Test the plug-in as in part 1d above.

AJDT Plugin Export Wizard - TBD:
Export as directory structure, Test an AJ project with different build options, test
or remove the save as ant build option.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the following jar export tests, need to create your own plugin project:

1. File > New > Plugin project
2. fill in Name = helloWorld and click next
3. click "next"
4. Select "create a plugin using one of the templates" and highlight
   the "Hello, World" template
5. click finish
6. Convert your project to be an AspectJ Project
7. Add the following aspect to the helloWorld package:

package helloWorld;

public aspect HelloAspect {

	String around () : call(String getMessage()) {
		return proceed() + " and hello from AspectJ";
	}
	
}

8. Save and build the project.

3. AJDT JAR Export Wizard – Export generated class files
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 a.	If you have not already done so, create the test plug-in project as defined above
 b.	Right click on the project then click ‘Export’.  Select ‘JAR file with AspectJ
    Support’, then click ‘Next’. Check ‘Export generated class files…’ and ensure that
    ‘Export java source files…’ is not checked.  
 c.	Select an appropriate location for the JAR file (e.g. C:\temp\hw.jar). Click
    ‘Finish’.
 d.	Open the JAR using WinZip or an equivalent tool.  It should contain
    HelloAspect.class, SampleAction.class and HelloWorldPlugin.class.  It may contain
    other resources, but should not contain HelloAspect.aj. (WIZ_5)

4. AJDT JAR Export Wizard – Export output folders

 a.	If you have not already done so, create the test plug-in project as defined above 
    (or use the copy you created for test 3.)
 b.	Right click on the project then click ‘Export’.  Select ‘JAR file with AspectJ
    Support’, then click ‘Next’.  Check ‘Export all output folders…’ and ensure that
    ‘Export java source files…’ is not checked.  
 c.	Select an appropriate location for the JAR file then click ‘Finish’.
 d.	Open the JAR.  It should contain HelloAspect.class, SampleAction.class and
    HelloWorldPlugin.class.  It should not contain HelloAspect.aj.  (WIZ_6)

5. AJDT JAR Export Wizard – Export source

7. New Aspect Wizard
--------------------

 a. Create the Bean Example.
 b. Select the "bean" package then File > New > Aspect
 c. The New Aspect wizard should appear, and the source folder and package fields
    should be filled in appropriately. (WIZ_9)
 d. Enter "MyAspect" and press Finish. A file called MyAspect.aj should be created
    in the bean package and opened in the editor. The contents should be a valid
    aspect definition. (WIZ_10)
 e. Select the "Bean Example" project, then select the New Aspect wizard using the
    toolbar shortcut (from the dropdown menu by the New Class wizard button).
 f. The New Aspect wizard should appear, and the source folder field should be
    filled in appropriately, with the package field blank. (WIZ_11)
