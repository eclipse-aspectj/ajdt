Test Of Plug-in Project Behavior When Being Converted To aspectJ Projects

Bug 72007

1. Install new copies of eclipse and ajdt and check out "Hello World Java Plugin" 
from "org.eclipse.ajdt.tests/test projects" on the Eclipse CVS repository. 
Launch a runtime workbench and click ‘Sample Menu’ > ‘Sample Action’ to verify the 
plugin is working. You should see a dialog box containing the text “Hello Eclipse”. (PLUG_1)

2. Switch to the java perspective and open "Hello World Java Plugin" and then open its 
plugin.xml file. Click the dependencies tab which is found at the bottom of the new
window. And in the "Required Plugin-ins" section should be the plugins:
org.eclipse.ui and org.eclipse.core.runtime. (PLUG_2)

3. Right click the project and select "Convert to AspectJ project". You should be
prompted to import the org.aspectj.runtime plugin. Say Yes and check that the 
required plugin is added to the plugin.xml (PLUG_3)

4. Right click the project and select "Remove AspectJ Nature".  You should be prompted
to remove the org.aspectj.runtime dependency.  Say 'Yes' and check that the 
dependency has been removed from the plugin.xml (PLUG_4)

5. Now click "Add..." to the right of the "Required Plug-ins" box and add 
"org.aspectj.runtime" then save the file. Now right click the "Hello World Java Plugin" 
project and select "Convert to AspectJ Project". You should not be prompted. Check that
the "Required plug-ins"  section still only contains a single entry for
"org.aspectj.runtime". (PLUG_5)

6. Right click the "Hello World Java Plugin" project and then select "Remove AspectJ
Nature". You will be prompted again.  Click 'No' and check that the dependency
is not removed. (PLUG_6)
