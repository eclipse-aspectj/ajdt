Manual testing of build configurations
------------------------------------------

ade- 11-07-2008 These tests are for the old build configurator style. 
build.ajpropoerties are no longer used.  Rather, include/excudes of files are stored 
in the .classpath/


Tests for activation and including/excluding	

Start with tracing example, check that initially none of the files under the
lib, version1, version2, and version3 packages are included. (BC_1)

Right-click tracev2.ajproperties > AspectJ Tools > Apppy Build Configuration
The packages "tracing"  and "tracing.version2" are activated (filled icon),
and the files in the other packages are excluded (hollow icons). (BC_2)

Exclude "tracing/version2/Trace.aj" from the build path.
There should be problem markers in the problems view and the package explorer. Now
include this file and the problem markers should be cleared. (BC_3)

Now apply the tracev1.ajproperties configuration. The packages "tracing" 
and "tracing.version1" should now be included. (BC_4)
	
(bug 77261) Create a new top level folder (NOT a source folder)_called “nonsrc”, and copy a 
source file into it.	The copied file should be shown to be excluded from the build configuration
Right-click the new file to display the context menu	It should NOT be possible to include 
this file – the include option must be disabled, or absent.
Now make “nonsrc” into a source file (right click > Build Path > Use as Source Folder)	
It should now be possible to include and then exclude this file  (BC_5)
	
(bug 77179) Remove AspectJ nature from the project	
Refactor > Rename the tracing.version1 package to tracing.version10	The rename operation should 
complete successfully without error  (BC_6)

Select the project then "AspectJ Tools > Save Build Configuration As
Press OK and check that a build.ajproperties file is created in the project.
Check that it contains correct src.include and src.exclude lines  (BC_7)

Apply the tracev3.ajproperties file, then apply the build.ajproperties file,
and check that the appropriate include/exclude status is restored (BC_8)
