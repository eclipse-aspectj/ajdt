      Comparing crosscutting
    </h1>
    <p>
      If you change the pointcut associated with some advice, you may change the
      locations the advice affects. Similiarly if you add a new method, it may
      become advised by existing advice, or if you rename a method or change its
      signature, advice that was previously affecting it may no longer match. You
      may wish to use the Crosscutting Comparison view to compare the crosscutting
      relationships in an AspectJ project before and after such a change.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The list of crosscutting relationships in an AspectJ project can be saved
      out into a file. The relationships
      in this file can then be compared with a later version of the project, or with
      a crosscutting file that was created at a different time. This crosscutting information 
      includes details of those locations in a project that are being 
      affected by advice or inter-type declarations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The crosscutting relationships of two individual elements in a project
      can also be compared. This allows any differences in the places affected
      by two different advice elements to be easily determined. Declare error
      and warning elements can also be compared against other declare elements,
      or against advice elements.
