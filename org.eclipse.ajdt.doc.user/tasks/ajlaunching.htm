      Launching a program with the main method in an aspect
    </h1>
    <p>
      The way to launch an AspectJ program where the main method is contained
      in an aspect is to use an <b>AspectJ/Java Application</b> launch 
      configuration. 
      <ol>
        <li>In the Package Explorer, select the compilation unit or 
            .aj file you want to launch.</li>
        <li>From the pop-up menu, select <b>Run &gt AspectJ/Java Application</b>. 
            Alternatively, select <b>Run &gt Run As &gt AspectJ/Java Application</b> 
            in the workbench menu bar, or select <b>Run As &gt AspectJ/Java Application</b> 
            in the drop-down menu on the <b>Run</b> tool bar button</li>
        <li>Your program is now launched, and text output is shown in the 
            Console.</li>
     </ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	  You can also launch an AspectJ program with the main method in an aspect,  by 
	  selecting a project instead of the compilation unit or .aj file.  You will 
	  be prompted to select the aspect from those aspects and classes that define a 
	  main method.
