      Creating an AspectJ plug-in project
    </h1>
<p>In the workspace, a plug-in is represented by a single project that has a 
plugin.xml (manifest) file at its root and that encapsulates all the code and 
resources of the plug-in.  An AspectJ plug-in project will have AspectJ nature,
will be build by the AspectJ builder and will normally depend on the AspectJ
runtime plug-in</p>
<p>To create a plug-in project, bring up the New Plug-in Project creation wizard 
via <b>File &gt; New &gt; Plug-in Project</b>.</p>
<p>A plug-in project can either be created as a Java project or a 
simple project. When creating an AspectJ plug-in project you must initially
create a Java plug-in project.</p>
<p>Complete the new plug-in wizard with the required details.  Please see the PDE guide for more information
on creating plug-in projects.</p>
<p>When you have created your plug-in, right click on the project in the package explorer
and select <strong>Convert to AspectJ project</strong>. You will be asked
whether you want to add the AspectJ runtime plug-in, org.aspectj.runtime as a plug-in
dependency.  Select <strong>Yes</strong>. You have now created an AspectJ plug-in project</p>
