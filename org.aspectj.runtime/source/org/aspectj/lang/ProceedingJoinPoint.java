     * <ul>
     * <li> If 'this()' was used in the pointcut for binding, it must be passed first in proceed(..).
     * <li> If 'target()' was used in the pointcut for binding, it must be passed next in proceed(..) -
     * it will be the first argument to proceed(..) if this() was not used for binding.
     * <li> Finally come all the arguments expected at the join point, in the order they are supplied
     * at the join point. Effectively the advice signature is ignored - it doesn't matter
     * if a subset of arguments were bound or the ordering was changed in the advice signature,
     * the proceed(..) calls takes all of them in the right order for the join point.
     * </ul>
     * Since proceed(..) in this case takes an Object array, AspectJ cannot do as much
     * compile time checking as it can for code style. If the rules above aren't obeyed
     * then it will unfortunately manifest as a runtime error.
